First, review the list of clusters and their descriptions:
<cluster_list>
{cluster_str}
</cluster_list>

Your task is to create at most {target_count} higher-level cluster names that could potentially include one or more of the provided clusters. These higher-level clusters should represent broader categories or themes that emerge from the given clusters, while remaining as specific as possible. If there are many clusters with a specific theme, ensure that the higher-level cluster name remains the maximum level of specificity.

Guidelines for creating higher-level cluster names:
1. Analyze the themes, topics or characteristics common to multiple clusters.
2. Create names that are specific enough to be meaningful but not so specific that they can't meaningfully represent many different clusters. Avoid overly general or vague terms, and do not hesitate to describe socially harmful or sensitive topics (in fact, clusters that clearly describe harmful behavior are slightly preferred); specificity is necessary for observability and enforcement.
3. Ensure that the higher-level cluster names are distinct from one another.
4. Use clear, concise, and descriptive language for the cluster names. Assume neither good nor bad faith for the content in the clusters.

Think about the relationships between the given clusters and potential overarching themes.

Focus on creating meaningful, distinct and precise (but not overly specific) higher-level cluster names that could encompass multiple sub-clusters.

CRITICAL: Prioritize SPECIFICITY over hitting target count exactly.
- Minimum output: {target_count} categories
- Target output: {int(target_count * 1.3)} categories (30% more is GOOD)
- Maximum output: {int(target_count * 1.5)} categories

It's better to have {int(target_count * 1.5)} specific categories than {target_count} generic ones.
When in doubt, CREATE MORE CATEGORIES rather than merging into generic buckets.

First, use <scratchpad> to:
- Identify 2-4 main behavioral patterns or user segments
- Note taxonomic dimensions (e.g., expertise, task complexity, autonomy)
- Consider what this reveals about how people conceptualize AI
- Check: are my categories specific enough? Do they avoid generic terms?
